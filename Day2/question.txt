Question 1: 
1. var and const in JavaScript are two different ways to define a variable in JavaScript.
2. var is function scoped i.e. available for reference in the entire function, whereas let is block scoped i.e. only referenceable in a {} or [] code block.
3. A variable declared by const cannot be changed, but a variable declared by let can.
4. 
- var: avoid using var, as its usage is antiquated.
- let: use it when you want the variable to be changeable.
- const: use it when you want the variable to be immutable i.e. cannot be changed.

Question 2:
1. Boolean is a primitive data type commonly used in programming languages, consisting of only two values: true and false.
2. E.g. in conditions, when a variable must be coerced into a boolean. The majority of values will result in true (called "truthy values"), but some will result in false (called "falsy values").

Question 2+: (the difference between strings and template strings)
- Strings are surrounded by "" or '', whereas template strings are surrounded by ``.
- Template strings allows for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
